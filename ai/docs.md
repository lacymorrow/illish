# Docs

These docs are outdated, I want you to create a plan and then go through page by page, section by section, and validate every word, comma, as well as augmenting and rewriting the entire thing basically from scratch. Keep your plan up to date so that if you are cut off and have to restart you can pick up where you left off.

use a code-first approach, validating the functionality entirely from the code, and deleting docs that are irrelevant, making sure that every single section and statement in the documentation matches the code and can be validated by you.@docs

We're using the latest next js 15, latest payload, etc

keep it short and succinct, comma, with very little fluff and full of information pertaining directly to code and code references.
